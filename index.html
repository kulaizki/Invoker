          <h2>Magic</h2>
          <p>
            Magic was originally based on memory and did not require any tools
            other than the magician's mind. Rituals were used as memory aids to
            recall the mental formulas that unlocked the power of spells.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, over time, magic evolved to incorporate tools and
            technology to enhance its power and make it more accessible to
            practitioners.

          <h2>Kael the Ultimate Wizard</h2>
          <p>
            Kael is a skilled wizard who is also known as the "Invoker" who can
            control the elements of Quas, Wex, and Exort. They can cast powerful
            spells, such as melting armor with fire and ice, conjuring an ice
            wall, lifting enemies with a tornado, and calling down a meteor.
            They can also use their abilities to push enemies and strike them
            with the sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Invoker is a versatile hero, able to adapt to different situations
            in battle. They can deal significant damage to multiple enemies,
            disrupt enemy movements, and control the battlefield with their
            spells.

          <h2>Genius</h2>
          <p>
            Among these early practitioners there was one exception, a genius of
            vast intellect and prodigious memory who came to be known as the
            Invoker.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his youth, the precocious wizard mastered not four, not
            five, not even seven incantations: He could command no fewer than
            ten spells, and cast them instantly.
